WhatsApp  interface with a custom app bar and three tabs: "Camera," "Chat," "Status," and "Calls." 
The "Chat" tab displays a list of chat contacts, "Status" tab shows status updates, and the "Calls" tab lists call history. 
The app bar has a title, search and more options icons, and a pop-up menu with options like "New Group," "Settings," and "Logout." 
The chat and call lists show profile pictures, names, and timestamps. 
The design mainly uses `ListView.builder` to generate dynamic lists and incorporates custom widgets for grouping status updates.
